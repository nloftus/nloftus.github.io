					<p><b>Day 1-4</b></p>
					<p>Starting the second week of this blog I'm starting working on the game(and this blog) at my school on the chromebook<br> the school gave me(and other classmates) (when I have time) to use until we graduate highschool(I mainly still do it at my home).<br>What I worked on for these few day are.</p>
					<p>DAY001
				   On Day001 at school I made it so when you start the game it goes to the main menu. I also made it so when you left click “Play Game” in the menu you go into the “Game” layout and made a options menu. I also made the layout for sensitivity options and made it so when the player hovers over the “Options” text on the game layout it goes to the “GeneralOptions” layout</p>
				   <p>DAY002
				   On Day002 at school I organized where my objects, event sheets, and layouts are into files in Construct</p>
				   <p>DAY003
				   On Day003 at school I made it so when the player health points are 0 the player object is destroyed and the layout is reset and made it so if the wall has 0 health it is destroyed.</p>																																																																																																																																																																																																								
				   
				<ul>

					<li>When you start the game it goes to the main menu.</li>
